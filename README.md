Summary:
> A while back I wrote a Python script that automated ticket creation for a ticketing system where my only option was to manually create tickets. I wrote python_script_efficiency_calculator.py to show how much time I've saved myself by automating ticket creation.

How it works:
> Simple. You will be prompted to enter the amount of tickets created then the script will show you how much time has been saved. Once the calculations are complete, you will have the option to run the script again with a new input.

Assumptions:
> 10 minutes is my (generous) estimate of how long it would take to create one ticket manually. The rest of the calculations are based on minutes, hours, days, etc.
