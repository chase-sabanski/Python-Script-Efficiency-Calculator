Summary:
> A while back I wrote a script that automated ticket creation for a ticketing system where my only option was to manually create tickets. I wrote python_script_efficiency_calculator.py to show how much time I've saved myself by automating ticket creation.

How it works:
> Simple. You will be prompted to enter the amount of tickets created then the script will show you how much time has been saved.

Assumptions:
> 10 minutes is my (generous) estimate of how long it would take to create one ticket manually. The rest of the calculations are based on minutes, hours, days, etc.
